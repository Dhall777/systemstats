## Project summary

The main idea is to read system statistics from the proc virtual filesystem (pvf) in real-time.
Right now, I've only cleaned up the memory information part, which kinda makes this a proof of concept at the moment.
The plan is to expand this application into the entirety of pvf.
More on the proc filesystem can be found below:
	- [Linux Kernel Docs | The /proc Filesystem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html)
	- Per GPT-3.5:
		-- The proc filesystem in Linux is a filesystem that provides a way of interacting with the kernel's data structures and retrieving information about system resources and processes. It does not contain actual files on disk, rather it is generated by the kernel at runtime and provides a view of the system's state. It is mounted at /proc and contains a hierarchy of directories representing different aspects of the system, such as /proc/cpuinfo for information about the CPU, /proc/meminfo for information about memory usage, and /proc/uptime for system uptime.


# Technical instruction

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Configure `config/dev.exs` (omitted for security purposes)
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create`, then `mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`, or run interactively without server using `iex -S mix`
  * To begin OS data "generators", uncomment appropriate lines in `lib/systemstats/application.ex`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
